# Bible API

This repository contains the backend code to serve bible verses over REST endpoints.
We aim to make the API and the source code as open as possible.
So, only Bible translations available in the public domain are available.

## Translations

Right now, the following translations are available. 
1. Tamil Old Version - TOVBSI (1957)
2. King James Version - KJV (1769) - WIP

## Sources
1. [TOVBSI](https://github.com/berinaniesh/bible-tamil)
2. KJV - Yet to be published
