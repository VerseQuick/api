# Bible API

This repository contains the backend code to serve bible verses over REST endpoints.
We aim to make the API and the source code as open as possible.
So, only Bible translations that are in the public domain are included. 

## Translations

At the moment, the following translations are available. 
1. Tamil Old Version - TOVBSI (1957)

## WIP

1. King James Version - KJV (1769) - WIP

## Sources
1. [TOVBSI](https://github.com/berinaniesh/bible-tamil)
2. [KJV](https://github.com/aruljohn/Bible-kjv)

## Bible requests

If you would like to add a Bible translation to the database, 
open an issue on GitHub and we will look into it. 
Any feature requests are also welcome.

## Contributions

Contributions in any form welcome too.
